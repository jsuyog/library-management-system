# library-management-system
Library management system is created in which added Create Books to add book in library which can be only accesed by the librarian, created issuebook function which will issue book to a certain address which can only be invoked by librarian, we can also return the book.

* In this we have created a simple frontend and connected it with the smart contract of the Library management system which will make the interaction very easy for users.
* I have also connected the metamask for automatic chain ID identification and user wallet address for interaction with the smart contract.
